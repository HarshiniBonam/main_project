This study proposes a novel Collaborative Filtering (CF) framework which integrates both subjective and objective information to generate recommendations for an active consumer.
The proposal framework can solve the problem of sparsity and the cold-start problem which affects traditional CF algorithms.
The fuzzy linguistic model, which is a more natural way for the consumer to present their preferences, is adopted within the proposed framework. 
Based on these concepts, two algorithms, a Simple Aggregated (SA) algorithm and Aggregated Subjective and Objective user’s Viewpoint (ASOV) algorithm are developed. 
A series of experiments are performed taking both algorithms with single and multiple subjective users’ preference, the results of which indicate that the proposed methodologies produce high-quality recommendations to an active consumer. 
Finally, the results confirm that the proposed algorithms perform better than the traditional method of Collaborative Filtering.
